# Features

Right clicking the top of a supported block with a rock smasher will smash it and return some resources.
Additionally, various stones will drop 3 or 4 pebbles instead of cobbled stones.

Rock Smashing recipes can be configured in `.minecraft/config/SmashingRocks/recipes`.
Some default recipes will be generated when the game starts if no recipes are found in the directory.

Currently, due to rock smashing recipes not actually being recipes, they will only be loaded when the game starts.
